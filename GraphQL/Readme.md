### **7. GraphQL with Apollo and Strawberry**

---

### **Beginner:**

1. **What is GraphQL, and how does it differ from REST APIs?**
   - **GraphQL** is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. Unlike REST APIs, which have fixed endpoints that return fixed data, GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need. It offers more flexibility and efficiency.
   
2. **What are the main components of a GraphQL API?**
   - The main components of a GraphQL API are:
     - **Schema**: Defines the types of data that can be queried and mutated.
     - **Queries**: Read operations to fetch data.
     - **Mutations**: Write operations to modify data.
     - **Resolvers**: Functions that handle fetching data for each field in the schema.
   
3. **How do queries work in GraphQL?**
   - Queries in GraphQL specify the data structure clients want. The server then responds with exactly that data, often in a nested format.

4. **What is the purpose of mutations in GraphQL?**
   - Mutations in GraphQL allow clients to modify data (create, update, delete). They are similar to POST, PUT, and DELETE requests in REST.

5. **What is Apollo Client, and how does it work with React?**
   - **Apollo Client** is a library that manages data fetching, caching, and state management for GraphQL in React applications. It integrates seamlessly with React through a context provider and hooks like `useQuery` and `useMutation`.

6. **How do you set up an Apollo Server in a Node.js/Express.js application?**
   - You set up an Apollo Server by creating a new instance and passing it the GraphQL schema and resolvers, then linking it to an Express.js server.

7. **What is the role of a resolver in GraphQL?**
   - A **resolver** is a function that retrieves data for a field in a query. It can fetch data from a database, API, or other sources.

8. **How do you define a GraphQL schema?**
   - A **GraphQL schema** is defined using a Schema Definition Language (SDL) to declare types (objects, queries, mutations), fields, and their respective data types.

9. **What is a type in GraphQL, and how do you define custom types?**
   - **Types** define the structure of your data. You can define custom types by creating a new object type using the `type` keyword in the schema.

10. **How does error handling work in GraphQL?**
    - Errors in GraphQL can be captured at the resolver level. The server responds with an `errors` array if there is any issue, providing details about the failure.

### **Mid-Level:**

1. **How do you manage state with Apollo Client?**
   - Apollo Client uses its **cache** to store the data fetched from the server, allowing for state management without the need for a global state library like Redux.

2. **What are GraphQL subscriptions, and how do they work?**
   - **Subscriptions** allow clients to listen for real-time updates from the server. They use WebSockets to maintain a persistent connection to the server for sending updates.

3. **How do you implement authentication and authorization in GraphQL?**
   - Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens or sessions. Authorization can be handled by creating custom middleware or using a resolver to check if the user is authorized to access specific data.

4. **How does Apollo Server handle caching?**
   - Apollo Server supports **automatic caching** of queries. You can customize caching with directives like `@cacheControl` or use external caching solutions like Redis for more advanced scenarios.

5. **What are fragments in GraphQL, and how do you use them?**
   - **Fragments** allow you to reuse parts of a query. They define reusable sets of fields that can be included in multiple queries to avoid repetition.

6. **How do you batch multiple GraphQL queries into a single request?**
   - GraphQL allows you to send multiple queries in a single request by including them as separate fields in a single JSON payload.

7. **What is data fetching in GraphQL, and how does Apollo handle it?**
   - Data fetching in GraphQL is done using queries that specify the exact fields needed. Apollo Client handles the data fetching, caching, and state management.

8. **How do you optimize GraphQL queries for better performance?**
   - You can optimize queries by using **fragments**, **batching**, **pagination**, and **avoiding over-fetching** of data.

9. **How do you handle pagination in GraphQL?**
   - **Pagination** is typically handled using cursor-based pagination, where each page of results has a unique cursor that the client can use to request the next set of data.

10. **How do you integrate Apollo Client with Next.js?**
    - You integrate Apollo Client with Next.js by wrapping your app in an ApolloProvider component and using Apollo Client hooks within your pages or components.

### **Senior-Level:**

1. **What are the differences between Apollo Client and Relay?**
   - **Apollo Client** is more flexible and widely used, focusing on simplicity and caching. **Relay** is tightly integrated with React and is more opinionated, focusing on automatic query batching and data consistency.

2. **How does Apollo Federation work for microservices?**
   - **Apollo Federation** allows multiple GraphQL services to be combined into one unified schema. Each service is responsible for a part of the schema, and Apollo Gateway serves as a central point for combining them.

3. **How do you design a scalable GraphQL API architecture?**
   - A scalable GraphQL architecture should consider **modular schemas**, **caching**, **batching**, **subscriptions**, **horizontal scaling**, and **database optimizations** like connection pooling.

4. **How do you handle large datasets efficiently in GraphQL?**
   - Efficient handling of large datasets includes using **pagination**, **batching**, **caching**, and **optimized resolvers** that avoid fetching unnecessary data.

5. **What are GraphQL directives, and how do you use them?**
   - **Directives** modify the behavior of fields in GraphQL queries. For example, `@include` and `@skip` allow conditional fetching of fields.

6. **How do you secure GraphQL endpoints against common vulnerabilities?**
   - Secure GraphQL endpoints by using **rate limiting**, **input validation**, **authentication/authorization** mechanisms, and **proper logging**.

7. **How do you implement field-level permissions in GraphQL?**
   - Field-level permissions can be implemented by checking the user's roles/permissions within resolvers and denying access to specific fields if needed.

8. **How do you optimize GraphQL performance in a production environment?**
   - Optimize performance by using **caching**, **batched queries**, **pagination**, and **query depth limiting**. Also, consider **cost analysis** to detect complex queries.

9. **How do you implement real-time functionality using WebSockets in GraphQL?**
   - Real-time functionality is implemented using **subscriptions** over WebSockets. The client subscribes to events, and the server pushes updates to the client.

10. **How would you design a GraphQL API for a multi-tenant SaaS application?**
    - Design a multi-tenant GraphQL API by using a shared schema, segregating data per tenant, and implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and proper authorization mechanisms.
